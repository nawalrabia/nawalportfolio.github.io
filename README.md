### About Me
Hello! I'm a Data Science and Analysis professional with a Master’s degree (Distinction) from Coventry University and over five years of experience at Accenture. My passion lies in transforming complex data into strategic insights that drive impactful business solutions.

### Skills and Expertise
- **Programming Languages:** SQL, Python
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Expertise in building, training, and deploying models
- **Data Analysis:** Strong analytical skills with a knack for uncovering patterns and trends

### What I Do
At Accenture, my primary role involves application development and support, focusing on integrating data-driven solutions to enhance business operations. My expertise lies in leveraging complex datasets to build and maintain robust applications that improve service delivery and client satisfaction.

In addition to my responsibilities at Accenture, I am also engaged in a UK government-funded project with the Center for Factories of the Future at a renowned research company. Here, I focus on data science, particularly developing predictive models, performing deep data analyses, and creating interactive dashboards. My goal across these roles is to derive actionable insights that empower businesses to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of the digital age effectively.

### Projects
Here are a few highlights from my work through internships and Data Science competitions:

  - Utilized deep learning algorithms to predict DST index, resulting in accurate solar storm predictions.
  - DST (Disturbance Storm Time) prediction is crucial in space weather forecasting as it quantifies the intensity of geomagnetic storms, which can affect satellite operations, power grids, and navigation systems. Accurate DST forecasting helps mitigate the adverse impacts of geomagnetic disturbances by enabling timely protective measures. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to enhance the precision and reliability of DST predictions using real-time solar wind data.

- **Child Sexual Abusive Material, detecting CSAM Links Using Machine Learning Algorithm**
  ##### Funded by UK Government under Safety Tech Challenge

  #### [Child Sexual Abusive Material Detection](csamlinkdetection.md)
  
  - The escalating phenomenon of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) link shortening, and modification poses a significant threat in the online sphere. Traditional methods often prove inadequate in addressing this dynamic issue. The CSAMGuard project offers an innovative approach, leveraging machine learning to detect and prevent the propagation of CSAM. This paper delves into the project's background, objectives, key tasks, and the development of the Central CSAM Intelligence System (CCIS). It further explores the validation and assessment processes, evaluating the system's efficacy in real-world scenarios.

- **German Used Car Sales Forecasting Model**
  ##### Please click the link below to find more about the project
  #### [Exploring Used Car Listings on ebay in Germany:](usedcarssalesingermany.md)
  - Developed a machine learning model to predict used car sales, enabling the market to optimize price levels.
  - This study investigates the factors influencing used car prices in Germany using a comprehensive Kaggle dataset. By employing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression, we identify key relationships between car attributes and selling prices. Our findings highlight that the Gradient Boosting Regression model provides the most accurate price predictions, offering valuable insights for optimizing pricing strategies in the used car market.
